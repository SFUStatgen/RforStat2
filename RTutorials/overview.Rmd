[R](http://www.r-project.org) is a powerful environment for
statistical computing and graphics. We will be using R for
homework assignments as it is supported by the Stats Workshop. 
I would not say that you will "learn R" in this course. 
Instead you'll get example code in class notes or templates that you can 
modify to do your analyses. Your focus should be on getting
practice with data wrangling, analysis, and **interpretation**
of the results. In the course of doing the homework assignments
you will probably pick up a bit of R and you will have a set of
templates for doing future analyses (e.g., as a lab assistant 
at SFU), but you will not be a serious R user. Students
interested in learning R should consider taking Stat 341.

R may be downloaded from the 
[Comprehensive R Archive Network](http://cran.r-project.org) 
and comes with its own user interface called the R console.
However, I recommend using one of the following 3 
user interfaces for R, because they all have facilities for
integrating text, R code and R output that will simplify 
the process of doing assignments:

1. RStudio Desktop -- To get started, see [Getting started with R and RStudio](https://github.com/SFUStatgen/RforStat2/blob/master/Tutorials/GettingStarted/startR-RStudio.Rmd) for instructions.
2. RStudio Cloud -- To get started, see [Getting started with RStudio Cloud](https://github.com/SFUStatgen/RforStat2/blob/master/Tutorials/GettingStarted/startRStudioCloud.Rmd) for instructions.
3. R via Jupyter -- To get started, see the Stat Workshop's R/Jupyter page  [**ADD LINK to the Stat Workshop's R/Jupyter page for Fall 2018 once it is created**]

These interfaces are all supported by the Stat Workshop. A partial list of the pros and cons of each interface are given in the table below:

| Interface      | pros/cons | Comments                                           |
| -------------- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
RStudio Desktop | pros | You install your own (free) copy on your personal computer that you may then use in perpetuity for any future data-analysis projects. Has well-developed tools for authoring documents such as homework assignments and written reports. Supported by an extensive online community of users. Used in class demos. Statistics undergraduates and graduate students install it on their own computers and use it in their work; hence, someone in the Workshop should be able to help with installation if you bring in your computer. 
|   | cons  | Computers with non-standard characters on Macs (e.g. Chinese characters) can be trickier to install on. |
| RStudio Cloud | pros | No installation required; instead access is through the internet. A CloudFront (Amazon) server with the same interface as RStudio Desktop. |
|    | cons  | As an internet server on the Amazon Cloud, it may have slowdowns or outages from time to time.|
| Jupyter | pros | No installation required; instead access is through the internet. A UBC server with the Jupyter interface to an array of computing languages, as well as to R. Jupyter tutorial documents are available on the Workshop Canvas site but please be warned that they follow an approach to learning R that is different from the Tidyverse approach adopted in this course.|
|   | cons | As an internet server for BC university students, it may have slowdowns or outages before assignments are due or during other high-volume periods of the semester. Jupyter tutorial documents are available on the Workshop Canvas site but they follow an approach to learning R that is different from the Tidyverse approach adopted in this course and so may find them unhelpful for some people.|
