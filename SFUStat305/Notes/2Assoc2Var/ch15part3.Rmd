## Paired Data and McNemar's Test

<!--
* The chi-square test is not appropriate when the 
observations being counted in the table are paired in some way.
-->
* The chi-square test is not appropriate when the study is
designed to collect paired data.
* Example: Study of smoking habits over time.
    + A random sample of 2110 people were questioned about smoking status
    in 1980 and again in 1982.
    + Are smoking status and year associated?
i.e, does the population proportion of smokers 
differ by year?
    + Test $H_0: p_{1980} - p_{1982} = 0$ vs.
    $H_a: p_{1980} - p_{1982} \not = 0$,
    where $p_{1980}$ and $p_{1982}$ are the population
    proportions of smokers in 1980 and 1982, respectively. 

* The data might look as follows:

\footnotesize

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cll}
       &\multicolumn{2}{c}{\underline{Smoking}}\\ 
person & 1980 & 1982 \\
1 & no & yes \\
2 & no & no \\
3 & yes & no \\
$\vdots$ & $\vdots$ & $\vdots$ \\
2110 & yes & yes \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\normalsize

##         

* The research question is about the
association between smoking status and year.
So we might arrange the data in a table as:

\footnotesize

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll|c|c|r}
& \multicolumn{1}{c}{}& \multicolumn{2}{c}{Year} & \\
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{1980} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{1982} & \\ \cline{3-4}
Smoke & Yes & 717 & 696 & 1413 \\ \cline{3-4}
& No &  1393 & 1414 & 2807 \\ \cline{3-4}
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{2110} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{2110} & 4220 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\normalsize 

* But this table is misleading: the 4220 observations that it 
reports are from 2110 double-counted people.

* The 4220 observations counted in the table are not independent, 
but rather paired observations from just 2110 people.

## 

* To clarify the paired nature of the data, they are typically  arranged as:

\footnotesize

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll|c|c|r}
& \multicolumn{1}{c}{}& \multicolumn{2}{c}{1982 (after)} & \\
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Smoker} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Nonsmoker} & \\ \cline{3-4}
1980 (before) & Smoker & 620 & 97 & 717 \\ \cline{3-4}
& Nonsmoker &  76 & 1317 & 1393 \\ \cline{3-4}
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{696} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{1414} & 2110 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\normalsize

* The observations that are counted in the cells of this table 
are people and are independent.

* If we were to apply a chi-square test to this table, we'd be testing
whether a person's smoking statuses in 1982 and 1980 are associated.

## 

* The chi-square test addresses the question: "Is a person's 1982 smoking status independent of their 1980 smoking status?", or
\footnotesize
$$H_0: P(1982  \mbox{ smoker} | 1980 \mbox{ smoker}) = 
    P(1982 \mbox{ smoker} | 1980 \mbox{ non-smoker})$$    
     \hspace{ 1in} vs.
    $$H_a: P(1982 \mbox{ smoker} | 1980 \mbox{ smoker}) 
    \not = P(1982 \mbox{ smoker} | 1980 \mbox{ non-smoker})$$

\normalsize

* **Not** the research question we're interested in. 

* Want to test whether or not the population proportion of smokers in 1980,
$p_{1980}$, is the same as the population proportion of smokers 
in 1982, $p_{1982}$; i.e., test
$$ H_0: p_{1982} = p_{1980} \mbox{ vs. } H_a: p_{1982} \not= p_{1980}.$$

## How to use the table to test our hypotheses? 

\footnotesize

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll|c|c|r}
& \multicolumn{1}{c}{}& \multicolumn{2}{c}{1982 (after)} & \\
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Smoker} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Nonsmoker} & \\ \cline{3-4}
1980 (before) & Smoker & 620 &  $r=97$ & 717 \\ \cline{3-4}
& Nonsmoker &  $s=76$ & 1317 & 1393 \\ \cline{3-4}
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{696} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{1414} & $n=2110$ \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\normalsize

* Our sample of 2110 individuals has 620 continuing smokers, $r=97$ quitters and $s=76$ starters in 1982.
* In 1980 and 1982, the sample proportions of smokers are, respectively,
    + $\hat{p}_{1980} = (620+r)/n=(620+97)/2110$
    + $\hat{p}_{1982}=(620+s)/n = (620+76)/2110$

* So, $\hat{p}_{1980} \not= \hat{p}_{1982}$
when $r \not= s$; 
or when $\hat{p}_{start} \not= \hat{p}_{quit}$, where
    + $\hat{p}_{start} = s/n$ is the proportion starting in 1982
    + $\hat{p}_{quit}=r/n$ is the proportion quitting in 1982. 
    
* Re-express 
 $H_0: p_{1980} - p_{1982} = 0$ vs.
    $H_a: p_{1980} - p_{1982} \not = 0$ as
    + $H_0': p_{quit} = p_{start}$ vs.
$H_a':p_{quit} \not= p_{start}$.


## McNemar's Test

* Base the hypothesis test of
$$H_0': p_{quit} = p_{start} \mbox{ vs. }
H_a':p_{quit} \not= p_{start}$$
on the difference in observed proportions
$$\hat{p}_{start} - \hat{p}_{quit}=(r-s)/n$$
and its standard error.
* Skip the derivation but the test statistic ends up being:
$$
X^2 = \frac{(r-s)^2}{r+s} \sim \chi^2_1 .
$$
* If the number of quitters, $r$,
is very different from the number of starters, $s$, 
the statistic $X^2$ is **big** and we reject $H_0$ in favour of $H_a$. 
* An alternate form  that uses a
continuity correction for small samples (text, page 351)  is
$$
X^2 = \frac{(|r-s|-1)^2}{r+s} \sim \chi^2_1 .
$$


## McNemar's Test for the Smoking Data

* We have $r=97$ and $s=76$. The test statistic with 
continuity correction is 
$$ \frac{(|97-76|-1)^2}{97+76} = 2.31$$
and the corresponding p-value 
is 0.128 (see R demo).

<!--
\scriptsize

```{r}
X2 <- (abs(97-76)-1)^2/(97+76)
X2
pval<-pchisq(X2,df=1,lower.tail=FALSE)
pval
```

\normalsize
-->

*  Taking $\alpha=.05$, there is insufficient statistical evidence to conclude that smoking status is associated with year (the pvalue 0.128 is $>0.05$).

## Notes

\footnotesize

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll|c|c|r}
& \multicolumn{1}{c}{}& \multicolumn{2}{c}{1982 (after)} & \\
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Smoker} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Nonsmoker} & \\ \cline{3-4}
1980 (before) & Smoker & 620 &  $r=97$ & 717 \\ \cline{3-4}

\normalsize

* In the smoking-example table,
    + Cells with the same before- and after-status
of the subject are called _concordant_.
    + Cells with different before- and after-status 
are called _discordant_.

* In general, cells that are diagonal entries 
are _concordant_ and cells that are off-diagonal entries are _discordant_. 

* Note that McNemar's test is a contrast between the discordant cells only, and ignores
the concordant cells.

## Other Examples of Paired Data

* Scoring individuals from the same matched pair.
    + e.g. case-control pairs in which the control has been matched to the case on a number of characteristics. 
* Scoring the same experimental unit with two different techniques
* Ratings of the same experimental unit by two different raters
* Scoring genetic variants from the same parent for transmission 
and non-transmission to an offspring. 

## Example: Transmission/Disequilibrium Test (TDT)

* [Spielman _et al._, 1993](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1682161/) \tiny click \normalsize
applied McNemar's test to a problem in medical genetics.
* DNA segments that are
physically close together on a chromosome, or genetically _linked_ tend
to be co-transmitted from parent to offspring.
    + A DNA marker that is physically close to a 
    disease-causing mutation tends to be co-transmitted with the disease.
* Application to autoimmune or type 1 diabetes (T1D):
    + Is the DNA marker 5'FP
    (near the insulin gene) _linked_ 
    to a
    disease-causing mutation?
    + If so, certain variants of 5'FP will be
    over-represented in transmissions from parents to 
    children affected by T1D.

    
## Diabetes Data from [Spielman _et al._](http://people.stat.sfu.ca/~jgraham/Teaching/S305_17/Data/tdt.csv)

* The DNA marker had two variants, "1" and "X". 

* Study of 124 parents of children with T1D
    + Parents chosen to carry both a 1 and an X at the DNA marker.

* Is variant type associated with transmission status?
    + e.g., test $H_0: P(1| \mbox{transmitted}) = P( 1 | \mbox{untransmitted})$    
     vs. $H_a: P(1| \mbox{transmitted}) \not= P( 1 | \mbox{untransmitted})$

* The dataset has
     a row for each parent, and
    two columns, one for the variant that was transmitted 
    from the parent to the affected child, and one for the 
    variant that was not transmitted.

                   untransmitted = factor(c(rep("X",78),rep("1",46))))

##

* The research question is about whether variant type is associated with transmission status and so we might arrange the data in a table as: 

\footnotesize

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll|c|c|r}
& \multicolumn{1}{c}{}& \multicolumn{2}{c}{Transmitted} & \\
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{yes} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{no} & \\ \cline{3-4}
Variant & 1 & 78 & 46 & 124 \\ \cline{3-4}
& X &  46 & 78 & 124 \\ \cline{3-4}
&\multicolumn{1}{c}{} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{124} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{124} & 248 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\normalsize 

* But this table is misleading: the 248 observations that it 
reports are the outcomes of transmission events from 124 double-counted parents.

* The 248 observations counted in the table are not independent, 
but rather paired observations from just 124 parents.

## 

* To clarify the paired nature of the data, cross-tabulate the `transmitted` and `untransmitted` variables in the original dataset.

\vspace*{-.15in}
\scriptsize
```{r}
tt <- table(tdtex)
tt
```
\normalsize

\vspace*{-.15in}

* The observations that are counted in the cells of this table 
are parents and are independent.

* If we were to apply a chi-square test to this table, we'd be testing
whether a (1,X) parent's transmitted variant is associated with his/her
untransmitted variant. 
    + We don't need a test to see immediately that they are perfectly
    negatively dependent, _by definition_.
    + If one variant gets transmitted then the other one does not
    
* A chi-square test is not relevant to the research question.


## McNemar's test on T1D Data

* Research question: Is variant type associated with transmission status?
    + i.e., $H_0: P(1 | \mbox{transmitted}) = P(1 | \mbox{untransmitted})$     
    vs. $H_a: P(1 | \mbox{transmitted}) \not= P(1 | \mbox{untransmitted}).$

* Use McNemar's test (see R Demo): 

\scriptsize

```{r}
mcnemar.test(tt,correct=FALSE)
```

\normalsize
\vspace*{-.06in}

* Strong evidence that variant type is associated with 
transmission status. 

## 

\scriptsize
```{r}
tt <- table(tdtex)
tt
```
\normalsize

* In particular, the "1" variant appears to be
preferentially transmitted over the "X" variant 
to the affected child.

* Can conclude that the DNA marker 5'FP is genetically
    linked to T1D.

* 5'FP is a DNA marker on chromosome 11, very close to the 
insulin gene. 
    + Makes biological sense that DNA variation around the insulin gene
    would affect the risk of type 1 diabetes.
    + Body attacks and kills all the insulin-producing
    cells in the pancreas.
    
<!--
* Recent work [e.g., Pugliese (2005)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16081366)
suggests that variation in gene expression in the thymus is
a risk factor for T1D, so perhaps the causal locus is in 
the promoter region of the insulin gene.
