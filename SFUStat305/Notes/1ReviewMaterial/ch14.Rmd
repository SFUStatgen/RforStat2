## Inference for Proportions (Chapter 14)

* Instead of quantitative measurements, we classify each sampled individual 
into one of two categories.
    + success, failure (canonical)
    + breast cancer, no breast cancer
    + Etc.
* Want to make inference about the proportion $p$ of successes
in a population, or about
the difference between the proportions $p_1$ and $p_2$ of successes in two populations.

## Example: Women's Health Initiative (WHI)
* A randomized controlled trial, called
the Women's Health Initiative, randomized 16,608 post-menopausal women aged
50-79 years to receive either hormone replacement therapy in the form of estrogen plus progestin (EP; $n_1=8506$), or a placebo
($n_2=8102$). 
* After five years, 166 of those in the EP group had developed 
invasive breast cancer, compared to 122 in the placebo group.
* The populations to compare are postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years, who are 
taking EP (population 1) or placebo (population 2).
* The sample proportions are
$\hat{p}_1 = 166/8506=0.0195$ and $\hat{p}_2=122/8102=0.0151$
* It looks like the EP group has a higher risk of 
breast cancer, but could this difference be due to chance?


## Outline of Approach

* Similar approach to inference of population means 
(quantitative outcomes), with some minor differences.
* Inference is based on the sampling distribution of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$
* Two-stage reasoning:
     1. Transform the statistic $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ into an initial pivotal quantity, $Z_1$, whose denominator depends on the unknown parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$.
     2. Get a final pivotal quantity, $Z$, by replacing 
the unknown $p_i$'s in the denominator of $Z_1$ with estimates.
* CIs and hypothesis tests follow from 
the approximate sampling distribution of the final pivotal quantity, $Z$.
* Note: Not covering _Inference for a single proportion_ (text, sections 14.2 -- 14.5).

## Sampling Distribution of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$

* Assume that we have independent simple random samples 
(SRSs) of size $n_1$ and $n_2$, from the two parent populations.

* Then the distribution of $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$ has
    + mean $p_1-p_2$ and
    + SD 
    $$
    \sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)/n_1 + p_2(1-p_2)/n_2}.
    $$
* If the sample sizes are ``large'', the CLT tells us 
that the shape of this distribution is approximately normal.
    + (The CLT applies because it turns out that a proportion is an average $\ldots$ of 0's and 1's.)


## Initial Transformation

* For large samples, $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$ is **approximately** normally distributed with 
    + mean $p_1-p_2$, and 
    + SD
$$\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)/n_1 + p_2(1-p_2)/n_2}$$.
* So the distribution of
$$
Z_1 = \frac{ (\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2) - (p_1-p_2)}{\sqrt{p_1(1-p_1)/n_1 + p_2(1-p_2)/n_2}}
$$
is **approximately** $N(0,1)$.


## $Z_1$ with Estimated SDs

* Inserting the estimates $\hat{p}_1$ and $\hat{p}_2$ for the unknown parameters 
$p_1$ and  $p_2$ into $Z_1$ above gives
$$
Z= \frac{(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)-(p_1-p_2)}{\sqrt{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)/n_1 + \hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)/n_2}}
$$
* What is the distribution of $Z$? 
    + Under certain conditions (see below) it is reasonable to assume that $Z$ is approximately normal.

-->

## Pivotal Quantity $Z$

$$
Z= \frac{(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)-(p_1-p_2)}{\sqrt{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)/n_1 + \hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)/n_2}}
$$

* What is the distribution of $Z$? 
    + Under certain conditions (see below) it is reasonable to assume that $Z$ is approximately normal.

## Rule of Thumb for Normal Approximation

* The normal approximation to the distribution of $Z$ is considered reliable when the sample sizes $n_1$ and $n_2$ are "large"
* The definition of large depends on the underlying $p_j$'s.
The text (page 324) suggests:
    + $n_1p_1 \geq 5$ and $n_1(1-p_1) \geq 5$ and
    + $n_2p_2 \geq 5$ and $n_2(1-p_2) \geq 5$
* The parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$ are not known so we insert the estimates
$\hat{p}_1=(\mbox{number of successes in sample 1})/n_1$ and $\hat{p}_2= (\mbox{number of successes in sample 2})/n_2$. 
* After inserting estimates, one can simplify the 
requirements to the following rule: 
    + The normal approximation is reliable when there 
    are at least 5 successes _and_ 5 failures in 
    both sample 1 and sample 2.  
    
    
## Checking rule of thumb for WHI Data

* At least 5 successes and failures in both samples.
    + True: 166 cancer, 8340 cancer-free in the EP group;
    122 cancer, 7980 cancer-free in the placebo group.


## Confidence Intervals

* The level-$C$ CI for $p_1-p_2$ is of the form:
$$ {\rm estimate } \pm {\rm margin } \; {\rm of } \; {\rm error} $$
* The estimate is $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$
* The margin of error is $z^* \times SE$ where 
    + $z^*$ is the upper $(1-C)/2$ critical value of the standard normal 
distribution.
    + $SE$ is the estimated SD of $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2$ in the denominator of $Z$; namely, $SE=\sqrt{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)/n_1 + \hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)/n_2}$

##  Example (WHI)

* Recall: 16,608 women aged 50-79 years randomized to
receive either estrogen plus progestin (EP; $n_1=8506$), or a placebo
($n_2=8102$). After five years, 166 in the EP group developed 
invasive breast cancer, compared to 122 in placebo group.

* For EP, $\hat{p}_1 = 166/8506$ and, for placebo, $\hat{p}_2 = 122/8102$.

\scriptsize

```{r}
numCancer1 <- 166; n1 <- 8506; p1hat <- numCancer1/n1
numCancer2 <- 122; n2 <- 8102; p2hat <- numCancer2/n2
phatDiff <- p1hat - p2hat
```

\normalsize

* 95\% CI is estimate $\pm$ margin of error, where
    + estimate of $p_1-p_2$ is $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = 0.0044$ 
    + margin of error is a critical value times standard error of difference.
    
* The critical value is $1.96$ (see R demo).

* The standard error is $\sqrt{ \hat{p}_1 (1 - \hat{p}_1)/n_1 + \hat{p}_2 (1- \hat{p}_2)/n_2} = 0.002$

* The margin of error is therefore $1.96*.002=0.00392$.

* Putting it all together, the CI is $0.0044 \pm 0.00392$ or approximately 
$(0.0005, 0.008)$.

    
\scriptsize

```{r}
zstar <- qnorm((1-.95)/2,lower.tail=FALSE) #Get critical value
se <- sqrt(p1hat*(1-p1hat)/n1 + p2hat*(1-p2hat)/n2)
CI <- c(phatDiff - zstar*se,phatDiff + zstar*se)
```
\normalsize


## Test Statistic

* The null hypothesis is $H_0: p_1-p_2=0$.
* Numerator of the test statistic is therefore the estimated difference 
$(\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2)$ minus $0$.
* Denominator of the test statistic is
$$SE=\sqrt{\hat{p}_1(1-\hat{p}_1)/n_1 + \hat{p}_2(1-\hat{p}_2)/n_2}$$
* BUT, under $H_0$, we have $p_1=p_2$. Call this common value $p$. 
* Assuming a common proportion $p$ in the two populations, we pool 
the 2 samples to obtain an estimate $\hat{p}$; i.e., 
$$\hat{p} = \mbox{(number of cancers in both samples)}/(n_1+n_2).$$
* The formula for the SE of $\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2$ simplifies to
$\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\times \left( 1/n_1 + 1/n_2 \right)}$
* So the statistic for testing $H_0: p_1-p_2=0$ is
$$
Z=\frac{(\hat{p}_1-\hat{p}_2)}{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\left( 1/n_1 + 1/n_2 \right)}}
$$


## Example (WHI, continued)

* $H_0: p_1-p_2=0$. 
* Test statistic numerator is $\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = 0.0044$.
* Test statistic denominator is the SE based on the pooled estimate of $p=p_1=p_2$.
    + Pooled estimate of the common population proportion is $\hat{p}=(166+122)/(8506+8102)=0.0173$.
    + So the SE is
    \begin{eqnarray*}
    \lefteqn{\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})\left( 1/n_1 + 1/n_2 \right)}} & & \\
    & = & \sqrt{0.0173(1-0.0173) \left( 1/8506 + 1/8102 \right )} \\
    & = & 0.002.
    \end{eqnarray*}
    
* The test statistic value is $z=0.0044/0.002 = 2.2$.


## $p$-value

* The $p$-value is the chance of a value of the test statistic that is as or more extreme
than what we did observe in our data, when the null hypothesis is true.
* Same logic as we saw earlier for inference of population means (Chapter 11).
* Let $Z$ be a standard normal random variable and 
$z$ be the observed value of the test statistic. 
* For $H_a: p_1 -p_2 \not= 0$, the $p$-value is $p= 2 P( Z\geq |z|)$.

## Example (WHI, continued)

* Suppose we wish to test    
$H_0$: $p_1 - p_2 = 0$ vs. $H_a$: $p_1 - p_2 \not = 0$ at level $\alpha=0.05$.

* For an observed value of the test statistic $z=2.2$, computer software
calculates a pvalue of about 0.03 (see R demo)

\scriptsize

```{r}
phat <- (numCancer1+numCancer2)/(n1+n2)
se <- sqrt(phat*(1-phat)*(1/n1+1/n2)) #based on pooled-sample estimate of p
z <- phatDiff/se
pval<-2*pnorm(abs(z),lower.tail=FALSE) #get the pvalue
```
\normalsize

* We therefore reject $H_0$ at the 5\% level:
There is statistical evidence that women taking EP have a higher 
risk of invasive breast cancer than those taking the placebo.
    + Note: The EP group appears to have a higher risk of breast cancer than the placebo
    group because $\hat{p}_1$ (for EP) is greater than $\hat{p}_2$ (for placebo), as reflected by $z=2.2$ being greater than zero.


## Summary

* Inference for the difference $p_1-p_2$ between two population
proportions is based on a pivotal quantity.
* Confidence intervals are of the form **estimate $\pm$ margin of error**, where
    + estimate is difference between sample proportions, and
    + margin of error is a critical value times the 
    standard error of the difference in sample proportions
* To test the null hypothesis $H_0:p_1 - p_2 = 0$ against 
an alternative $H_a$ we calculate a test statistic 
and the $p$-value
    + The $p$-value is the chance of seeing a value of the test statistic as or more extreme 
than the value that was observed in our data, under the null hypothesis.
    + Compare the $p$-value to a significance level $\alpha$ to obtain a statistical hypothesis test
* The statistical inference is considered reliable when
there are at least 5 successes and 5 failures in each sample.
