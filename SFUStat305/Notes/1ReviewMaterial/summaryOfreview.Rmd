## Ch8-10: Inference of a Population Mean

* A statistic is computed from data on a
sample; e.g. $\bar{X}$, the sample average.
* By contrast, a parameter is a population
quantity; e.g. $\mu$, the population average.
* Statistical inference: Learning about 
parameters from statistics that are subject to random 
variation.
    + e.g. Hypothesize about parameters such as $\mu$.
    + Test $H_0: \mu=0$ vs. $H_a: \mu \not= 0$.
    
##

* Key point: Even though the population mean, $\mu$, 
and the population SD, $\sigma$, are unknown, 
we know the (approximate) distribution of the pivotal
quantity 
$$T= \frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{s/\sqrt{n}},$$
regardless of
the shape of the population distribution for $X$.
* This result relies on the CLT, which tells us 
that (large) sample averages such as $\bar{X}$ are approximately normally distributed.
* Many of the statistics we will study are based on averages,
so inference of a population mean is a useful template.
* Knowing the distribution of the pivotal quantity
allows us to construct confidence intervals,
calculate $p$-values, test statistical hypotheses, 
calculate power, etc.

## Ch11: Inference for a Difference of Population Means

* Inference for the difference 
between two population
means is based on either the pivotal quantity $Z$ (SDs known) or 
$T$ (SDs unknown).
* CIs are of the form estimate $\pm$ margin of error
    + the margin of error is a critical value ($z^*$ for $Z$, $t^*$ for $T$) times the SE for the estimate.
* To test $H_0:\mu_1 - \mu_2 = 0$  against $H_a: \mu_1 - \mu_2 \not= 0$ 
    + We use our sample of data to compute the observed value $t$ (or $z$ if SDs known) of a test statistic. 
    + We compare this observed value to a reference distribution for the test statistic obtained under $H_0$.
    + The $p$-value is the chance of seeing a value of the test statistic as or more extreme 
than the value that was observed, under $H_0$.
    + Compare the $p$-value to a significance level $\alpha$ to obtain a test of $H_0$ against $H_a$.
* Inference is considered reliable when the parent populations are normal, or 
when rules-of-thumb about sample sizes for the CLT are satisfied.

## Ch14: Inference for Proportions
* Inference for the difference $p_1-p_2$ between two population
proportions is based on a pivotal quantity, also called $Z$.
* CIs are estimate $\pm$ margin of error, where
    + estimate is the difference between sample proportions, and
    + margin of error is a critical value ($z^*$) times the 
    SE (estimated SD) of the difference in sample proportions.
* To test $H_0:p_1 - p_2 = 0$  against $H_a:p_1 - p_2 \not= 0$
    + We use our sample of data to compute the observed value $z$ of a test statistic. 
     + We compare this observed value to a reference distribution for the test statistic obtained under $H_0$.
    + The $p$-value is the chance of seeing a value of the test statistic as or more extreme 
than the value that was observed, under $H_0$.
    + Compare the $p$-value to a significance level $\alpha$ to obtain a test of $H_0$ against $H_a$.
* Inference is considered reliable when there are sufficient numbers of successes and failures
in each sample for the CLT to hold.

## Ch6: Probability

* Discussed the basic definitions and rules
of probability, including the definition of conditional probability.
* Use Bayes' Theorem to relate $P(A\mid B)$ to
    + $P(B\mid A)$, $P(A)$ and $P(B)$.
* Public-health and medical 
practitioners work with many conditional probabilities every day; e.g.,
    + diagnostic test sensitivity and specificity
    + relative risks and odds ratios
* Case-control data
    + Disease probabilities or risks in the exposure groups
    cannot be estimated, owing to oversampling of the cases
    in the study design.
    + However, exposure probabilities in the disease groups
    can be estimated, allowing us to estimate odds ratios.
    + For a rare disease, the odds ratio approximates
    the relative risk.
