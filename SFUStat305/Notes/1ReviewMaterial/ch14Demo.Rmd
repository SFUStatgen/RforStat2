## Test and CI 

* Can use `prop.test()` function to get  $p$-value and CI.


\scriptsize
```{r}
prop.test(c(166,122),c(8506,8102),conf.level=0.95,correct=FALSE)
```

\normalsize

## Arguments 

\bigskip

\scriptsize
`prop.test(c(166,122),c(8506,8102),conf.level=0.95,correct=FALSE)`

\normalsize

\bigskip

In the call above to `prop.test()`:
    
+ The first argument contains the numbers of "successes" (cancers) in the EP and placebo groups,
    respectively.

+ The 2nd argument contains the numbers of "trials" (women) in the EP and placebo groups, respectively. 
    
+ `conf.level` is the level or coverage probability $C$ of the interval 
    (default = 0.95).
    
+ `correct` specifies whether to apply a "continuity correction"
    that improves the statistical inference
     when the total size of the sample is small. 
    The default is `correct=TRUE`,
    but I set `correct=FALSE` to re-create
    the results from using the formulas in the text. 
    
## Output

\scriptsize
```{r, echo=FALSE}
prop.test(c(166,122),c(8506,8102),conf.level=0.95,correct=FALSE)
```

+ Mostly like the output of `t.test()`

+ `X-squared` is the square of the test statistic
    $Z$ that we discussed in the non-demo part of these notes. 
+ `X-squared`$=Z^2$ has a chi-squared
    ($\chi^2$)
    distribution with 1 df. Leads to a $\chi^2$ test.

+ When $H_a$ is 2-sided, the p-values for the 
    $\chi^2$- and $Z$-tests are the same; i.e. $p=0.02783$.
