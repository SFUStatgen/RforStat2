Instructions for Exercises

Templates for exercise sets are to be downloaded from the class website and modified to include your answers.

**For each set of exercises** do the following:

-   Download the template to your computer. To do so, click on the link to the RMarkdown (`.Rmd`) file if you use RStudio (Desktop or Cloud) or the Jupyter notebook (`.ipynb`) if you use Jupyter. Look for and click the "Raw" button near the top of the web page to see the file in its raw form. Use your browser's `File -> Save As` feature to save the file to the appropriate folder on your computer (e.g. the folder where you do you Stat305 homework assignments).
    -   Note: Some computers will add or ask to add a ".txt" extension to the file. Say "no" or, if it has been added, remove the ".txt" extension manually yourself. Otherwise, RStudio won't recognize the .Rmd file and Jupyter won't recognize the .ipynb file.
-   If your R interface is a server (RStudio Cloud or Jupyter), upload the template to the server. For example, RStudio Cloud users can use the upload button found in the files pane in the lower right corner of their RStudio.
    -   Jupyter users will find that the templates require a few minor modifications before you start. See the instructions [here](https://github.com/SFUStatgen/RforStat2/blob/master/SFUStat305/Exercises/Instructions/TemplateMods.pdf)
-   Start your R interface and open the template.
-   Change the name, student ID and date in the header of the template to your own.
-   Add your answers to the template.
-   When you are finished adding your answers, knit (RStudio) or run (Jupyter) the document to an HTML file. Save this file for reference during the quiz based on the exercise set.
