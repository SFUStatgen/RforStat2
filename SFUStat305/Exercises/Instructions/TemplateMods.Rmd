## Overview

All question templates
were originally created in RMarkdown. The Jupyter
notebook versions were created with
a converstion tool called `notedown`. Unfortunately,
the conversion is not perfect and you will have to
make the following modifications to the 
templates **before** adding your answers. 

I will suppose that you have downloaded the notebook 
template from the class website and have uploaded it
to the Jupyter server. To start, you will see something
like the following screenshot:

## Modifications

1. Change the "kernel". Jupyter doesn't know that 
this notebook contains R code. Click the "Kernel" 
menu item, then "Change kernel", then "R".

2. Reformat the title area. Double click the text cell
that contains the title. You should see something like
the following:   
```
---
title: "Assignment 1, Question 1"
author: "Your Name Here; Your Student ID number Here"
date: 'Put date here in YYYY-MM-DD format'
output: html_document
---
```
Remove the lines with three dashes, `---`, and the line
`output: html_document`. These are needed for 
the RMarkdown header but are not needed for your
Jupyter notebook. While you are here, put your 
name and student number in the "author" line and 
the date in the "date" line. After your modifications 
you would see something like the following.
```
title: "Assignment 1, Question 1"
author: "John Doe; 300012345"
date: '2018-09-16'
```


3. Remove the `knitr` options used by RMarkdown. 
Click on the code cell that contains 
`knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)`. Then click 
the "Edit" menu item and choose "Delete Cells".

4. Save. Click the floppy disk icon below the "File"
menu to save your work. You are now ready to answer
the questions.
